Select data for color grade "D"

Filter out value 0

Interpolate with moving average to get the "truth" image. Assign nodata value 0

Convert image to an indexed array and get the nodata index

Interpolate with nearest neyghbour to get to row image (pixel value is the nearest row)

Convert image to indexed array using the previous nodata index. This array will be used to creater a mask for each row

loop for increased filtering (e.g step):
	apply filterig step to the data
	interpolate with inverse distance
	convert image to array and apply index
	
	loop for each row:
		create a mask for a row
		apply mask to "truth" and interpolated array
		calculate statistics for this row
		compare truth and interpolated and calculate some statistics
